# Clean Architecture Demo: Web API with .NET Core and Entity Framework

This demo project illustrates the implementation of a Web API using Clean Architecture principles, built with .NET Core and Entity Framework.

## Overview

The Clean Architecture demo showcases a well-structured, modular, and testable Web API architecture, emphasizing separation of concerns and maintainability.

### Features

- **.NET Core Web API**: Backend server developed using .NET Core for RESTful API endpoints.
- **Entity Framework**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for interacting with the database.
- **Clean Architecture Principles**: Emphasizes separation of concerns and testability.

## Getting Started

To run this demo locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.
- Database (e.g., SQL Server) setup and configured.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Configure the database connection in the `appsettings.json` file.
4. Run database migrations using Entity Framework.
5. Start the API using `dotnet run`.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core**: Framework for building cross-platform applications.
- **Entity Framework**: ORM for interacting with the database.

## Clean Architecture Principles

This demo adheres to Clean Architecture principles, including:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Divides the application into distinct layers: presentation, domain, and data.
- **Dependency Rule**: Inner layers are independent of outer layers.

## Usage

The demo provides endpoints following RESTful conventions for CRUD operations. Refer to the API documentation for detailed usage instructions.

## Challenges Faced

During development, challenges were encountered, including:

- **Abstraction Overhead**: Balancing abstraction to maintain a clear separation of concerns without overcomplicating the architecture.
- **Testing Complexity**: Implementing effective testing strategies within the Clean Architecture structure.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements and improvements for this demo may include:

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling mechanisms.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Adding logging and monitoring functionalities for better diagnostics.
- **Further Testing**: Expanding test coverage for better code reliability.
